Simple recipe site that will have additional features at a later date

So far this is a super basic template, but I plan on adding additional elements later down the line to make it more reactive as well as adding additional colors and formatting specifications to make it look prettier overall.

I heavily recommend the dip! :D

To-do:

- Add CSS styling
- Reactive JS
